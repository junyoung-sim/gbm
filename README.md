# Stock Price Modeling

Playground for learning and simulating stock prices through stochastic and statistical methods.

## Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)

Geometric Brownian Motion is a stochastic process that models a randomly varying quantity following a Brownian motion with drift.
It's a popular stochastic method for simulating stock prices that follow a trend while experiencing a random walk of up-and-downs characterizing risk.

The following notes were used to my implementation of GBM (./GeometricBrownianMotion.ipynb):
