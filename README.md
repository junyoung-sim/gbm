# Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)

Geometric Brownian Motion is a stochastic process that models a randomly varying quantity following a Brownian motion with drift.
It is a popular stochastic method for simulating stock prices that follow a trend while experiencing a random walk of up-and-downs characterizing risk.

The following notes were used for my implementation of GBM:
